## 1️⃣ What is the difference between `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, and `querySelector` / `querySelectorAll`?

### ✅ Answer:

- **`getElementById()`**
  - Finds a single element by its unique `id`.
  - Returns one element.

- **`getElementsByClassName()`**
  - Finds all elements with a specific class name.
  - Returns an **HTMLCollection** (live collection).

- **`querySelector()`**
  - Uses CSS selectors.
  - Returns the **first matching element** only.

- **`querySelectorAll()`**
  - Uses CSS selectors.
  - Returns **all matching elements** as a **NodeList**.

## 2️⃣ How do you create and insert a new element into the DOM?

### ✅ Steps:

### 🔹 Step 1: Create an element

```javascript
const para = document.createElement("div");
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Set content and attributes

```javascript
para.textContent = "I am a new card!";
para.className = "content px-4 py-4 flex justify-between";
para.style.color = "green";
```

### 🔹 Step 3: Insert into the page

```javascript
const container = document.getElementById("container");
container.appendChild(para);
```

---

### 🔹 Other methods to insert elements:

- `appendChild()` → Adds at the end of parent  
- `prepend()` → Adds at the beginning of parent  
- `insertBefore()` → Inserts before a specific child  
- `insertAdjacentHTML()` → Inserts at specific positions  

⚠️ Although `innerHTML` can also be used, it is less safe.  
It is generally better to use `createElement()` + `textContent`.

## 3️⃣ What is Event Bubbling? How does it work?

### ✅ Answer:

When an event occurs on an element (like a click), it doesn’t stop there.  
The event travels upward through its parent elements until it reaches the `document`.

This upward movement is called **Event Bubbling**.

Think of it like a bubble rising from bottom to top.

### 📌 Example:

```html
<div id="grandparent">
  <div id="parent">
    <button id="child">Click!</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

If you click the button, the event flows like this:

```
button → parent → grandparent → document
```

---

### 📌 Event Flow Phases:

1. **Capturing Phase**  
   Event travels DOWN from `document` to the target element.

2. **Target Phase**  
   Event reaches the clicked element.

3. **Bubbling Phase**  
   Event travels UP from the target element back to `document`.

---

### 💡 Why Event Bubbling is Useful:

- You don’t need separate listeners for every child element.
- Improves performance.
- Makes code cleaner and more dynamic.

---

## 4️⃣ What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

### ✅ Answer:

**Event Delegation** is a technique where instead of adding event listeners to multiple child elements, you add one listener to the parent and detect which child was clicked using `event.target`.

It works because of **Event Bubbling**.

---

### 💡 Benefits of Event Delegation:

- ✔ Less code (one listener instead of many)
- ✔ Better performance (fewer listeners)
- ✔ Works for dynamically added elements
- ✔ Easier to maintain

## 5️⃣ What is the difference between `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`?

### ✅ Explanation:

- **`preventDefault()`**
  - Stops the browser’s default behavior.
  - Example: Prevent form submission or link navigation.
  - Event bubbling still continues.

- **`stopPropagation()`**
  - Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
  - Default browser behavior still happens.

---

### 📊 Key Differences:

| Feature              | `preventDefault()` | `stopPropagation()` |
|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Stops default action | ✅ Yes            | ❌ No               |
| Stops bubbling       | ❌ No             | ✅ Yes              |
| Common use           | Forms, links      | Nested click events |
